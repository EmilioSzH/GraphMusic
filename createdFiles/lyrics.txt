[Verse 1]
Trees reach high, edges call
Cycles spin, graphs enthrall
Nodes refine, roots astute
Graphs design, goals pursuit

[Chorus]
Paths align, logic at play
CS 5002 leads the way
Paths align, logic at play
CS 5002 leads the way

[Verse 2]
Functions rise, answers fall
Sorting schemes that solve it all
Shortest paths, we compute
Nodes refine, roots astute

[Chorus]
Paths align, logic at play
CS 5002 leads the way
Paths align, logic at play
CS 5002 leads the way

[Bridge]
Graphs reveal a hidden theme
Counting dreams, logic supreme
CS 5002 builds unity
Dr. Amjad inspires me

[Chorus]
Paths align, logic at play
CS 5002 leads the way
Paths align, logic at play
CS 5002 leads the way
